# Fizz Buzz

### Fizz Buzz program used to practice programming logic and sintax. 

## Task
Build a Fizz Buzz program that takes outputs a list of numbers and prints fizz or buzz depending on whether the numbers are even or odd.

* The program should open on a browser

* The program should be visually appealing

* The program must be written in simple JS without using any additional frameworks

* Use version control (github)

* Make the design of the program visually appealing

## Summary
This application was built in order to practice java script and DOM manipulation. The program does not make use of any third party libraries. 

In addition the project also is used to practice a minimalist design. 
Not only the program completes the desired task, but the program was used to practice design principles. 

## Functionality
The program display a set of integer numbers and outputs the string fizz or buzz depending on the divisibility of each individual integer. 

In addition, the program allows the user to control certain paramethers such as what values will be divisible by the fizz values, the divisibility of the buzz value, the starting number and the end number. 

## Design
